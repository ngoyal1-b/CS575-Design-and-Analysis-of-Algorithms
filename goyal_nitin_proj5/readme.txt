Programming Assignment 5


tar file contains

1)hw5.c - program to generate the value of n and profit and weight array
2)brute.c - program which uses brute force to solve 0/1 knapsack
3)dp.c - program for solving 0/1 knapsack using dynamic programming
4)backtrack.c - to solve 0/1 knapsack using backtracking algorithm
5)makefile
6)readme.txt

Steps to run program:-

Commands on Command prompt

1) make - it will compile all 4 c programs and also execute object files
 ./hw5 knapsack01.txt - creates a file called knapsack01.txt which contains value of n and profit,weight
 ./brute knapsack01.txt - it will get the inputs from knapsack01.txt and creates a file called output1.txt which contains output
 ./dp knapsack01.txt - it will get the inputs from knapsack01.txt and creates a file called output2.txt which contains output and enteries2.txt
 ./backtrack knapsack01.txt - it will get the inputs from knapsack01.txt and creates a file called output3.txt which contains output and 			enteries3.txt

 it will produce all output files and enteries file
